<p align="center">This is the official repository for <b>Toy Language.</b></p>

Welcome to the **ToyLang**! This is a simple, yet fun, programming language designed for learning and experimentation. It includes essential programming constructs and serves as a perfect project for those wanting to understand the fundamentals of building a custom language. 

This language features core constructs like variable assignment, condition management, loops, console logging, and basic arithmetic operations.

> **Note:** This is a **toy language** for practice and educational purposes, not a fully functional language like Python, C, or C++. Itâ€™s designed to help you understand the basics of creating a programming language from scratch.

## Features ðŸš€

ToyLang covers all basic features of a programming language which are sufficient to understand and buld a programming language from scratch.

- **Variable Assignment**: Support for basic variable assignments (`a = 10;`).
- **Condition Management**: `if`, `else` and `elif` statements to handle conditional logic.
- **Loops**: `while` and `for` loop to create repetitive tasks.
- **Console Logging**: Built-in `log()` function to output to the console.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How It Works ðŸ’»

This language is interpreted, meaning itâ€™s parsed and evaluated line-by-line. The interpreter reads the code, creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and evaluates the nodes according to the logic defined in the evaluator.
